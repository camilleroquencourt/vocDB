obstructive sleep apnea,D020181,"Sleep Apnea, Obstructive","A disorder characterized by recurrent apneas during sleep despite persistent respiratory efforts. It is due to upper airway obstruction. The respiratory
pauses may induce HYPERCAPNIA or HYPOXIA. Cardiac arrhythmias and elevation of
systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures may occur. Frequent partial arousals
occur throughout sleep, resulting in relative SLEEP DEPRIVATION and daytime
tiredness. Associated conditions include OBESITY; ACROMEGALY; MYXEDEMA;
micrognathia; MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY; adenotonsilar dystrophy; and NEUROMUSCULAR
DISEASES. (From Adams et al., Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, p395)
