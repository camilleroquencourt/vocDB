asthma,D001249,Asthma,"A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and
intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION. It is characterized by spasmodic contraction of 
airway smooth muscle, WHEEZING, and dyspnea (DYSPNEA, PAROXYSMAL)."
cystic fibrosis,D003550,Cystic Fibrosis,"An autosomal recessive genetic disease of the EXOCRINE GLANDS. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE
REGULATOR expressed in several organs including the LUNG, the PANCREAS, the
BILIARY SYSTEM, and the SWEAT GLANDS. Cystic fibrosis is characterized by
epithelial secretory dysfunction associated with ductal obstruction resulting in 
AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION; chronic RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS; PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY;
maldigestion; salt depletion; and HEAT PROSTRATION.

idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,D054990,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,"A common interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology, usually occurring between 50-70 years of age. Clinically, it is characterized by an insidious onset of
breathlessness with exertion and a nonproductive cough, leading to progressive
DYSPNEA. Pathological features show scant interstitial inflammation, patchy
collagen fibrosis, prominent fibroblast proliferation foci, and microscopic
honeycomb change.
