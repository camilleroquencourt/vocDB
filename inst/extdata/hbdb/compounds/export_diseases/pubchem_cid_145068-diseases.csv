asbestosis,D001195,Asbestosis,"A form of pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of asbestos fibers which elicit potent inflammatory responses in the parenchyma of the lung. The disease is
characterized by interstitial fibrosis of the lung, varying from scattered sites 
to extensive scarring of the alveolar interstitium."
asthma,D001249,Asthma,"A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and
intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION. It is characterized by spasmodic contraction of 
airway smooth muscle, WHEEZING, and dyspnea (DYSPNEA, PAROXYSMAL)."
cystic fibrosis,D003550,Cystic Fibrosis,"An autosomal recessive genetic disease of the EXOCRINE GLANDS. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE
REGULATOR expressed in several organs including the LUNG, the PANCREAS, the
BILIARY SYSTEM, and the SWEAT GLANDS. Cystic fibrosis is characterized by
epithelial secretory dysfunction associated with ductal obstruction resulting in 
AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION; chronic RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS; PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY;
maldigestion; salt depletion; and HEAT PROSTRATION.

upper and lower airway inflammation in Atopic dermatitis (AD),D003876,"Dermatitis, Atopic","A chronic inflammatory genetically determined disease of the skin marked by increased ability to form reagin (IgE), with increased susceptibility to allergic
rhinitis and asthma, and hereditary disposition to a lowered threshold for
pruritus. It is manifested by lichenification, excoriation, and crusting, mainly 
on the flexural surfaces of the elbow and knee. In infants it is known as
infantile eczema."
primary ciliary dyskinesia,D007619,Kartagener Syndrome,"An autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a triad of DEXTROCARDIA; INFERTILITY; and SINUSITIS. The syndrome is caused by mutations of DYNEIN genes
encoding motility proteins which are components of sperm tails, and CILIA in the 
respiratory and the reproductive tracts.
Year introduced: 2002 (1963)"
obstructive sleep apnea,D020181,"Sleep Apnea, Obstructive","A disorder characterized by recurrent apneas during sleep despite persistent respiratory efforts. It is due to upper airway obstruction. The respiratory
pauses may induce HYPERCAPNIA or HYPOXIA. Cardiac arrhythmias and elevation of
systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures may occur. Frequent partial arousals
occur throughout sleep, resulting in relative SLEEP DEPRIVATION and daytime
tiredness. Associated conditions include OBESITY; ACROMEGALY; MYXEDEMA;
micrognathia; MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY; adenotonsilar dystrophy; and NEUROMUSCULAR
DISEASES. (From Adams et al., Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, p395)
Year introduced: 2000"
obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,D009765,Obesity,"A status with BODY WEIGHT that is grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess FATS in the body. The standards may
vary with age, sex, genetic or cultural background. In the BODY MASS INDEX, a BMI
greater than 30.0 kg/m2 is considered obese, and a BMI greater than 40.0 kg/m2 is
considered morbidly obese (MORBID OBESITY)."
