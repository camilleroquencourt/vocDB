therapeutic efforts.

chronic cough,D002908,Chronic Disease,"Diseases which have one or more of the following characteristics: they are permanent, leave residual disability, are caused by nonreversible pathological
alteration, require special training of the patient for rehabilitation, or may be

cystic fibrosis,D003550,Cystic Fibrosis,"An autosomal recessive genetic disease of the EXOCRINE GLANDS. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE
REGULATOR expressed in several organs including the LUNG, the PANCREAS, the
BILIARY SYSTEM, and the SWEAT GLANDS. Cystic fibrosis is characterized by
epithelial secretory dysfunction associated with ductal obstruction resulting in 
AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION; chronic RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS; PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY;
maldigestion; salt depletion; and HEAT PROSTRATION.

upper and lower airway inflammation in Atopic dermatitis (AD),D003876,"Dermatitis, Atopic","A chronic inflammatory genetically determined disease of the skin marked by increased ability to form reagin (IgE), with increased susceptibility to allergic
rhinitis and asthma, and hereditary disposition to a lowered threshold for
pruritus. It is manifested by lichenification, excoriation, and crusting, mainly 
on the flexural surfaces of the elbow and knee. In infants it is known as
infantile eczema."
Heart Failure,D006333,Heart Failure,"A heterogeneous condition in which the heart is unable to pump out sufficient blood to meet the metabolic need of the body. Heart failure can be caused by
structural defects, functional abnormalities (VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION), or a
sudden overload beyond its capacity. Chronic heart failure is more common than
acute heart failure which results from sudden insult to cardiac function, such as
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
Year introduced: 2008 (1966)"
primary ciliary dyskinesia,D007619,Kartagener Syndrome,"An autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a triad of DEXTROCARDIA; INFERTILITY; and SINUSITIS. The syndrome is caused by mutations of DYNEIN genes
encoding motility proteins which are components of sperm tails, and CILIA in the 
respiratory and the reproductive tracts.
Year introduced: 2002 (1963)"
Cough,D003371,Cough,"A sudden, audible expulsion of air from the lungs through a partially closed glottis, preceded by inhalation. It is a protective response that serves to clear
the trachea, bronchi, and/or lungs of irritants and secretions, or to prevent
aspiration of foreign materials into the lungs."

sarcoidosis,D012507,Sarcoidosis,"An idiopathic systemic inflammatory granulomatous disorder comprised of epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells with little necrosis. It usually

systemic sclerosis,D012595,"Scleroderma, Systemic","A chronic multi-system disorder of CONNECTIVE TISSUE. It is characterized by SCLEROSIS in the SKIN, the LUNGS, the HEART, the GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, the
KIDNEYS, and the MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM. Other important features include
diseased small BLOOD VESSELS and AUTOANTIBODIES. The disorder is named for its
most prominent feature (hard skin), and classified into subsets by the extent of 
skin thickening: LIMITED SCLERODERMA and DIFFUSE SCLERODERMA.
